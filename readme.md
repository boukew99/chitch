# Chitch Software Development Kit

This is the Chitch Software Development Kit (SDK), used to build the [Chitch Website](https://chitch.org). It includes website builder functionality at a low-level, integrating deeply with the Operating System (Linux). This results in low resource usage, low complexity high portability and fast response times. Chitch can be forked and easily customized for your own wesbite.

Visit [chitch.org](https://chitch.org) for more information about Chitch. It also doubles as a demo of Chitch.

Benefits:
- Portable -> Serverless, Cross-Platform
- Low resource usage -> sustainable
- Low complexity -> low maintenance
- Lightweight -> responsive

> Chitch cannot hold long-lived connections like long-polling, SSE, or WebSockets. Chitch uses short-lived connections for lower resource usage. Because of this, true real-time interaction is not supported.

## Getting started
Download a stable build from the [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/boukew99/chitch/releases).

If you have PHP installed run `command/server.php` to start the server and open Chitch at the given address.

Visit `documents/installation.md` for more information on how to setup Chitch.

## Issue reporting
Issues with the software can be reported at https://github.com/boukew99/chitch/issues. This is a volunteering effort.

### Forking
The code is made available with the EUPL, which is a reciprocal license. [The EUPL can be read in multiple languages](https://eupl.eu/1.2/en/). The license was chosen for equal contributing rights and longevity of the software. You can fork Chitch under this license and use it for your own projects.
