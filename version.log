    - 'session/' component directory
    - markup 'p()' constructor
    - symlink generation in 'makefile'

    * Changed patch.log to be under version control. It keeps an human summary of past patches and its hashes and can be appended to for the current patch, which is then included in the patch file at the top.
    * Git repo is symlinked for compatibility with this version system.
    * Split start.sh into build.sh and run.sh. built script mainly packages a subset of files for multiple targets. One target is a Self Extracting Archive with stub.sh, which is useful for contained local testing. Another target is a shared host with PHP installed. With the tar --dereference option once can control wether the package is independent. build.sh has quality tests beforehand and a version control step afterwards. This version control step replaces update.php which calls git inside. We lose the interesting way in update.php where we use an array for operating on lines and appending to it from a command, but perhaps it is better done in the shell.
    * Changed the generated patch files to be read-only.
    * Added differ.php to view patch files. differ.php filters deleted files lines and has more color group filters.
    * Split help.txt into server/help.txt for installation steps and context.txt for programmers and Indexing.
    * Added symlink to the parent version within version control and for easy patch creation.
    * Added review.sh as an first automated review tool.
    * Changed run.sh to always runs from its residing directory.
    * Changed .htaccess to ensures all php files gain HTTPS, in order to have safe interaction.
    * Added URL shortcuts by appending '?shortcut' to the root /. This lets Apache handle it efficiently and allows the root page to be static HTML.
    * Changed install.php, which creates a key file upon its first visit which can viewed only be the host.
    * Changed library.php read and write function to now defined as minimal HTML text stream with commit markes, which can be concurrently read and write appended to.
    * Renamed public/ to html/ for Apache /var/www compatibility.
    * Added tree() for reverse breadth first HTML creation.
    * Changed similarity index to 1% (must indicate the orthogonality and uniqueness of the files!)

    * Surfaced 'source' directory.
    * Added .gitignore for binary and data.
    * Added access block above public directory.
    * Moved install.php in 'public/'.
    * Added php.ini setting.
    * Added help.txt next to '.sh' and '.bat' scripts.
    * Added concurrent file access method with read and write functions in library.php. Write is append-only and exlusively locked unless under 4 KiB. Read is never locked but relies on markers to indicate the stable part. Thus reading is never locked and writing is locked when needed on a per file basis. Also the functions have default behaviors now if file is missing.
    * Deprecate DOM manipulation on the server.
    * Replaced recursivefiles() by getfiles().
    * Changed tokenize() input from path to content.
    * Added inline HTML hiding in code.php.
    * Added pre and post hashes with the 'git --full-index' option.
    * Added safety with one-time key generation upon installation.
    * Simplified installation compatibility check.
    * Split review.php into update.php and manual.php.
    * Added status.php to check page availability.
    * Reduced update.php.

    * Split styles.css into code.css for developer-only styles.
    * Added CSS nesting for better intention declaration.
    * Added '.bat' file for starting the server in Windows file browser.
    * Moved filesystem checks to start.sh before server start.
    * Removed 'track' with the use of a lower similarity index threshold (15%), assuming highly orthogonal content.
    * Removed benchmark.php in favor for Web browser response analysis tools.

    * Some early work on handling the '3 error types'.
    * Added summuation of the all the PHP tokens.
    * Added .htaccess file was added to enhance the shared hosting setup.
    * Changed the HTTPS to be mandatory in the 'author/' directory.
    * Changed news.php takes edge approach where the content is send wholly and compressed to the client which filters it with DOM manipulation. This because the bottleneck is assumed to be the rendering and not content size. It also only requires DOM library on the client and not server.
    * Added hex colors from r/place 2022.
    * hotreload.js is not so useful anymore with longer pages.
    * Added 'commands' file to be sourced with the shell to do some system checking and starting php server.
