    <h1 id="chitch">Chitch</h1>
    <p>Chitch is a live template and is build as a new sustainable web application. It integrates with the filesystem to
        achieve transparent data flows and low resource usage. It can be forked and edited for your own blog or
        application,
        running locally, on your network or on the world wide web.</p>
    <blockquote>
            This project is in an <strong>experimental phase</strong> and is not yet consistent!

    <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
    <p>Chitch is fully <strong>self-contained</strong> and <strong>cross-platform</strong>, and thus you only need to
        extract it to run it. You can get a Chitch build specifically for your operating system from the <a
            href="https://github.com/boukew99/chitch/releases">Github Releases Page</a>.</p>
    <p>These bundles have a stable version of Chitch. To get the latest changes use <code>git pull</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="run">Run</h3>
    <p>In your file browser run <code>server/start.sh</code> on MacOS/Linux or <code>server/start.bat</code> on Windows.
        Open <a href="http://localhost:9000">http://localhost:9000</a> in your browser.</p>
    <p><em>MacOS</em>:
        You may need to <a
            href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac">allow
            the
            binary to run</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Windows</em>:
        for full compatibility, use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">officially
            supported
            Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> or use <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository">Github
            Codespaces</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
    <p>Deploy to the world wide web! Chitch requires the following features from a hosting setup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for usage of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</li>
        <li>Mail server, for mail() usage, used in login.</li>
        <li>Configurable Webroot/Document-root</li>
        <li>Green energy (Otherwise it won&#39;t run)</li>
        <li>Linux Operating System (the <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system">most used
                system on web servers</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="packaging">Packaging</h3>
    <p>In order to publish Chitch you first need to package the website for exportation. We can use a <strong>file
            browser</strong> for that.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the <code>application/</code> directory and post-fix the new directory name with the version number.
            For
            example <code>chitch-3-7</code>.</li>
        <li>Delete pages from <code>chitch-3-7/view/</code> which you don&#39;t require (superset).</li>
        <li>Open the Context Menu (Right-click) on <code>chitch-3-7</code> and Select the option to make it into a ZIP
            archive.<ul>
                <li>Windows: <code>Send To &gt; Compressed (zipped) folder</code></li>
                <li>Linux/MacOS: <code>Compress</code> as ZIP</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="shared-hosting">Shared hosting</h3>
    <p>Shared hosting is an efficient, cheap and accessible way to host a website. However, they are relatively
        restricted
        setups, so in order to make the setup universal, we need to deploy into <code>public_html</code> directly. The
        steps
        to install Chitch:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Upload and extract <code>chitch-3-7.zip</code> in <code>public_html/</code>.</li>
        <li>Set the Webroot with your <strong>hosts tools</strong> to <code>public_html/chitch-3-7/view/</code>.</li>
        <li>Go to the page <code>/install.php</code> on your domain and follow the instructions there.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>User specific data is meant to be stored in <code>database/</code>. On the shared hosting a <code>database</code>
        folder will be automatically created with the <code>install.php</code> process.</p>
    <h4 id="updating">Updating</h4>
    <p>We can do an <strong>atomic</strong> update to the host with the same process. The only thing to keep in mind is
        that
        the new ZIP will need a new version number, as not to overlap the current code during extraction. If you keep
        the
        old code around you can also switch back to the previous version of the site if something goes wrong. The
        database
        information should remain, so <code>/install.php</code> is not necessary and should remain forbidden to access.
    </p>
    <h4 id="assets-cdn-">Assets (CDN)</h4>
    <p>Assets such as images, audio and video are not included in the code, since these remain static and do not need
        frequent updates. Therefore, these assets are hosted on a subdomain. In this case <code>cdn.chitch.org</code>.
        These
        can be managed easily with FTP.</p>
    <p>For local development they can also be used, since the browser makes a cache of the assets, which will work
        offline
        as well.</p>
    <h2 id="issue-reporting">Issue reporting</h2>
    <p>Issues with the software can be reported at <a
            href="https://github.com/boukew99/chitch/issues">https://github.com/boukew99/chitch/issues</a>. Please use
        inclusive language. Note that Chitch accepts also <a
