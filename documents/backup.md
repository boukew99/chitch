# Back-ups

As the site gets used, data gets generated by users. This data is essential to the functioning of the site. Therefore it is essential to backup once in a while.

## Backing-up user data

Making a backup can be done via FTP. Simply make a ZIP of the `database/`. This is usually an option in the right-click menu. The file structure looks like this after creating the backup:

- chitch/
- database/
- database.zip

You can also add the date in the name if you have multiple backups, although the date should be in the metadata.

You can store this ZIP **safely** on another machine, athough your host usually should take care of reliability.

## Restoring backup

The created ZIP can be used to restore the database anytime by extracting it in the same place. This will essentially bring the site back to the state it was in at that time. Thus also all the newly generated data since the date of the backup is lost. Therefore only do a restoration if the current database is corrupted.

The restoration is a **time-sensitive** action. If you can, disable the site with your hosts tools temporarily. We cannot have new data be generated when replacing the database. Usually this *intermediate* gets overwritten, but could potentially instabalize the database.

The steps are:

1. Disable site access
2. Remove `database` directory
3. Unzip database.zip, which creates new `database` directory
4. Enable site access
